# Oaks-Decor-v0.9.1

Hello and welcome to the official project files for the Minecraft Java Edition mod Oaks Decor. I have made the project 
files open to the public as I would like anyone the ability to enjoy my mod in more ways then I could imagine, for example, if people would like to create custom ports to play in there 
favourite Java version and I don't actively support it, then you can. Another reason why I've made this Open Source is so people can create their own custom version of said mod,
if you want to tweak a crafting recipe, an items properites or the whole way it works then you can, tweak it the way you want too, as long as you don't publicly repost it.

As a solo developer it as been extremely diffcult to balance everything and I WOULD love to see what the community will do!
